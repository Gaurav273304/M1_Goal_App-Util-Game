# Requirements
Snake game is a computer action game, whose goal is to control a snake to 
move and collect food in a map. In this paper we develop a controller based
 on movement rating functions considering smoothness, space, and food. 
 Scores given by these functions are aggregated by linear weighted sum,
and the snake takes the action that leads to the highest score.
To find a set of good weight values, we apply an evolutionary algorithm.
 We examine several algorithm variants of different crossover and 
environmental selection operators. Experimental results show that our
 design method is able to generate smart controllers.

 # Low level Requirements:
 The low level required of the game is that you have to press the W button for going upwards press A button for going left W button for going down and D button for going right

 # High level Requirements:
 This project can be implemented by using c language in both windows and linux os.
